LLm Model
Project: Enhancing Student Performance in Sciences with LLMs
Objective
This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama2 and GPT-2 to analyze student performance data in science subjects. The goal is to generate personalized learning recommendations based on individual student performance, helping to improve their academic results and understanding of subjects like mathematics, physics, and chemistry.

Approach
Data Analysis: Analyze students' exam scores and performance across different science subjects to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Personalized Feedback: Use LLMs to generate text-based summaries and insights on each student's performance, as well as provide targeted recommendations to improve their learning.
Tools & Technologies:
R & Python: For data analysis and model training.
Llama2 & GPT-2: For generating text-based feedback and recommendations.
Vader Sentiment Analysis: To analyze student feedback and adjust recommendations based on emotional context.
Togather API: For integrating student engagement data to improve recommendation quality.
Impact
This system aims to provide actionable insights and custom learning paths, helping students improve their performance and guiding teachers in refining their teaching strategies.
